#### Experience

Staff Research Associate

University of California Los Angeles (2022 - present)

  * Conducting research in two labs investigating metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming across prostate cancer disease states:
    * [Goldstein lab](https://www.goldsteinlabucla.com/)
    * [Boutros lab](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/urology/iuo/research/faculty-labs/dr-paul-boutros-lab)
  * Leading two distinct projects in parallel
  * Hands-on experience in culturing and performing experiments with ~8 different prostate cancer model systems:
    * Lentiviral transductions 
    * Immunoblotting 
    * Metabolic tracing assays 
    * Viability assays 
  * Developing and applying computational pipelines for transcriptional analysis
  * Developing an R datasets package containing processed transcriptional data from over 200 samples across seven different studies at release:
    * Performed data curation and quality assessment where I detected and corrected sample swaps in external datasets 
    * Developed an object-oriented dataset class using the S4 system to enable easy access to metadata, sample information, and analysis methods 
    * Added gene set enrichment analysis and meta-analysis features 
    * Implemented a gene identifier mapping system to enable cross-species analysis without relying on external databases 
    * Resolved graphics-rendering failures caused by memory limits and label collisions in enrichment and volcano plots using custom downsampling and carteisan coordinate offsetting algorithms 
    * Extended the default lattice axes labeling system to support logarithmic axes 
    * Implemented a custom colour-mapping engine based on deriving and using an affine RGB transformation matrix, enabling continuous two-colour gradients and three-colour (diverging) schemes 

Lead K-12 Mathematics Instructor

Mathnasium, LLC (2019 - 2021)

  * Provided one-on-one and group tutoring in foundational mathematics (e.g. algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus) and other general science courses
  * Managed learning center operations on weekends:
    * Administered assessments to new students 
    * Managed student learning plans 
    * Followed up with leads 
    * Scheduled and matched instructors with students 

#### Education

BS: Biochemistry

University of California Los Angeles (2020-2022)

  * Conducted biomedical research while completing undergraduate coursework
  * Completed a graduate-level course in mass spectrometry proteomics, and upper-division electives in mathematics and machine learning

AA (honors): Social and Behavioral Science

Santa Monica College (2015-2020)

  * Explored multiple academic tracks before transitioning to STEM
  * Worked part-time in service roles and as a peer tutor for foundational science and math courses
