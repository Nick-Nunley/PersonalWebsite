#### Experience

Research Data Scientist & Software Engineer (Staff Research Associate)

University of California Los Angeles (2022 - 2025)

  * Hybrid data scientist, software engineer, and molecular and cell biology researcher that helped lead computational biology, statistical analysis, and production-grade software development
  * Built end-to-end computational pipelines and experimental research projects across transcriptomic analysis, metabolic profiling, and software development in two laboratories, resulting in three peer-reviewed publications, two open-source packages, and a poster:
    * [Goldstein lab](https://www.goldsteinlabucla.com/)
    * [Boutros lab](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/urology/iuo/research/faculty-labs/dr-paul-boutros-lab)
  * Owned and led two distinct research projects in parallel and developed a third open-source software project spanning experimental design, data analysis, and software development
  * Architected and released an R datasets package containing processed transcriptional data from over 200 samples across seven different studies at release:
    * Performed data curation and QA, detecting and correcting sample swaps in external datasets 
    * Built an object-oriented S4 dataset class to expose metadata, sample information, and analysis methods 
    * Added gene set enrichment analysis and meta-analysis features to the package 
    * Implemented a gene-identifier mapping system for cross-species analysis without external databases 
    * Resolved graphics rendering failures from memory limits and label collisions via custom downsampling and coordinate offsets 
    * Extended lattice axes labeling to support logarithmic axes 
    * Designed a custom colour-mapping engine for continuous and diverging gradients using affine RGB transformations 
  * Mentored junior-level colleagues in Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) practices, statistical modeling, & aseptic cell culture techniques
  * Conducted peer code reviews across pull-request-based and ad hoc workflows related to data quality assurance, quality control, reproducibility, & analytical correctness
  * Shipped RAGToolBox: a modular python package for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prototyping
    * Engineered 9 modules and 4 CLI entrypoints for loading, indexing, retrieval, and augmentation workflows 
    * Shipped v0.1.0 with a tagged release and changelog 
    * Deployed 3 CI/CD workflows via GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and release steps 
    * Published the package to PyPI 
    * Implemented continuous unit and integration testing to ~83% coverage 
  * Managed mammalian cell culture and functional assays across ~50 experiments and ~8 prostate cancer model systems, including lentiviral transduction, immunoblotting, metabolic tracing, and viability assays

Lead K-12 Mathematics Instructor

Mathnasium, LLC (2019 - 2021)

  * Provided one-on-one and group tutoring in foundational mathematics (e.g. algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus) and other general science courses
  * Managed learning center operations on weekends:
    * Administered assessments to onboard new students 
    * Managed student learning plans to track progress 
    * Followed up with leads to convert enrollments 
    * Scheduled and matched instructors with students to maintain coverage 

#### Education

BS: Biochemistry

University of California Los Angeles (2020-2022)

  * Conducted biomedical research while completing undergraduate coursework
  * Completed a graduate-level course in mass spectrometry proteomics, and upper-division electives in mathematics and machine learning

AA (honors): Social and Behavioral Science

Santa Monica College (2015-2020)

  * Explored multiple academic tracks before transitioning to STEM
  * Worked part-time in service roles and as a peer tutor for foundational science and math courses
