## RAGToolBox v0.1.0 is live üéâ

I built **RAGToolBox** to make it easy for AI apps to answer using *your* content quickly, cleanly, and without the bloat. It started as my way to learn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and it turned into a craft project - not just code, but a workflow. Along the way I wired in automated checks, meaningful tests, and a push-button release process - so every change ships with confidence. The result is a lightweight toolkit with heavyweight reliability.

This is a preview release; APIs may evolve based on feedback. I‚Äôm excited to shape it with real input from developers and users. If you kick the tires, please tell me what feels great and what feels off.
