I enjoy developing and applying analytical tools to better understand advanced disease initiation and progression. My research spans topics such as modeling gene expression, defining metabolic reprogramming, characterizing treatment resistance, and delineating lineage plasticity mechanisms in prostate cancer. Additional research interests include multi-omics integration, Bayesian statistics, data compression, machine learning, computational benchmarking, big data analytics, prognostic and therapeutic biomarker development, and ethical artificial intelligence engineering for biomedical applications. Advances in these areas will enable more reproducible and data-driven frameworks for gaining deeper insights into pathogenesis, ultimately improving how we detect, classify, and treat advanced diseases.
