I enjoy developing and applying analytical tools to better understand cancer initiation and progression. My research spans topics such as modeling gene expression, characterizing metabolic reprogramming, understanding treatment resistance, and delineating lineage plasticity in prostate cancer. Additional research interests include multi-omics integration, Bayesian statistics, data downsampling and compression techniques, machine learning, computational benchmarking, big data analytics, and ethical alignment of artificial intelligence in biomedical applications. Leveraging advances in these areas will enable more reproducible and data-driven frameworks for gaining deeper insights into cancer biology, ultimately improving how we detect, classify, and treat this disease.
