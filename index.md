I enjoy developing and applying advanced analytical tools to better understand cancer initiation and progression. My research spans topics such as multi-omics integration, Bayesian statistics, data downsampling and compression techniques, machine learning, and benchmarking. Leveraging advances in these areas will give us deeper insights into cancer biology.
