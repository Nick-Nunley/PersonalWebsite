I enjoy developing and applying advanced analytical tools to better understand cancer initiation and progression. My research spans topics such as modeling gene expression, characterizing metabolic reprogramming, understanding treatment resistance, and delineating lineage plasticity in prostate cancer. Additionally, my research interests cover topics such as multi-omics integration, Bayesian statistics, data downsampling and compression techniques, machine learning, and benchmarking. Leveraging advances in these areas will give us deeper insights into cancer biology.
