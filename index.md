I enjoy developing and applying analytical tools to better understand cancer initiation and progression. My research spans topics such as modeling gene expression, defining metabolic reprogramming, characterizing treatment resistance, and delineating lineage plasticity mechanisms in prostate cancer. Additional research interests include multi-omics integration, Bayesian statistics, data downsampling and compression techniques, machine learning, computational benchmarking, big data analytics, prognostic and therapeutic biomarker development, and ethical alignment of artificial intelligence in biomedical applications. Leveraging advances in these areas will enable more reproducible and data-driven frameworks for gaining deeper insights into cancer biology, ultimately improving how we detect, classify, and treat this disease.
